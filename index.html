            <P><b>We’re parents just like you. We understand the heartache, confusion, fear, anger, and the million other emotions that accompany an autism diagnosis. We also know that progress is on your side. No matter how severe the degree of autism may be, our children do progress. More and more of our children are even recovering from autism. Early intervention, therapies and treatments can lead to dramatic progress. Breakthroughs have already been made – some big, some small. Research will continue to help us have even more breakthroughs.
               Even during your most difficult times, hope will always be there. You will always have support among fellow parents, and you will always have hope.</b></P>

                <b>Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA)</b>
                        Applied Behavior Analysis involves many techniques for understanding and changing behavior. ABA is a flexible treatment:  
                Can be adapted to meet the needs of each unique person
                Provided in many different locations – at home, at school, and in the community
                Teaches skills that are useful in everyday life
                Can involve one-to-one teaching or group instruction
                Positive Reinforcement
                Positive reinforcement is one of the main strategies used in ABA.
                When a behavior is followed by something that is valued (a reward), a person is more likely to repeat that behavior. Over time, this encourages positive behavior change.
                First, the therapist identifies a goal behavior. Each time the person uses the behavior or skill successfully, they get a reward. The reward is meaningful to the individual – examples include praise, a toy or book, watching a video, access to playground or other location, and more.
                Positive rewards encourage the person to continue using the skill. Over time this leads to meaningful behavior change.
